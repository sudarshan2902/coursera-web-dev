                    <p> Pharmacy is an interesting and ever-changing field in our world today. An especially
                      intriguing aspect of this profession is the wide spectrum of opportunities available. With
                      such a versatile degree as a Doctor of Pharmacy, the possibilities for my future are
                      exciting. However, I believe that before a career is even considered, one must examine
                      her motivations.   </p></div>
